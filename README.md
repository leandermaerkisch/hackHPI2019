Basic map view. Nodes of the same color represent the same actor. Each node is the summary of one month of events, and is connected to the nodes of the previous and following month. The oldest nodes are opaque, gradually decreasing in opacity until the newest node, which is the brightest.

### Hover on node

While hovering on a node, the particular month is displayed, along with the name of the group and a summary of the events for that month. An animated ant trial shows the chronological connection to the previous and next month nodes.
